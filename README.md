The theater parent company shows the most fundraising campaigns. That means for Louise there is a lot of competition in the theater field.

In total have been in the US 912 theater campaigns. In the subcategory plays have been 671 campaigns. 412 have been successful and 250 failed. 
Roughly 2/3 of the campaigns have been successful, which means there is a good chance for Louise to be successful.

Louise should set her goal for the fundraising campaign moderately and not higher than the mean goal of 5034$. However there are also non funding goal related issues the other campaigns show. Sadly this issues can't be evalutated by the data. 


In regards our box plot research result for the Great Britain market Louise should try, if she wants to start a musical on the GB market to get it produced for less than 4000 pounds.

General recommendation:
Louise should overthink her intial estimated budget of 10.000$ for her play "Fever" and try either to cut costs of have a separate funding next to the kickstarter campaign.
