# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

A customer named Louise wants to launch her theater play "Fever" with the help of a fundraising campaign. 
The fundraising campaign is close to it's goal and Louise wants to launch "Fever" soon.

### Purpose

Before the launch Louise wants to have an advanced analysis about competitive fundraising campaigns.
Especially interesting for her are how other campaigns are behaving in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

To fulfill Louise request there will be 2 technical analysis performed. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The first anlaysis "Outcomes based on launch date" is giving insights about the success of other campaings in regards of their launch date. 
Interesting for Louise are the successful, failed and canceled campaigns in the theater parent category over all years since the dataset is started. 
The following graph shows on a monthly basis the outcome of the campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- In general the most campaigns get started in May and June. 
- May is the best month to have a succesful campaign in the Theater category. 
- The failed campaigns are over the whole year more stable than the successful ones, which have their peak in May. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
